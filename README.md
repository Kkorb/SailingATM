## ATM Command Line Interface Overview

Use command line from the root of the project for the following:

### Build
`./gradlew build`

### Test
`./gradle test`

### Execute
`./gradlew run`  
or  
`./gradlew jar`  
`java -jar build/libs/SailpointATM-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`  
Please create an account first before attempting to log in.  
Once an account is created you are able to check the balance and do any deposits or withdrawals.  
You can then log out which will bring you back to the main menu where you can create another account or log in again.
